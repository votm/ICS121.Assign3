If you wish to convey anything to the TA, please put it here.

A few things to note:
1) The program stopped running because of an OutOfMemoryError, so it's likely the entirety of the domain wasn't explored.
2) We sort subdomains primarily by number of occurrences and then alphabetically as a tie-breaker
3) The instructions on the website say to list the 500 most common words, but the instructions in CommonWords.txt say to list only the top 100. We chose to list the top 500.
