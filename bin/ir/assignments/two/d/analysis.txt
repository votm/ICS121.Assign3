Please place your analysis of the runtime complexity of your palindrome algorithm in this file.

"for" loop: O(n)
Inside "for" loop:
	-make new list: O(1)
	-make new hashtable: O(1)
	-check palindrom: O(1)
	-"while" loop and stuff inside: O(n)
	
-> So the total complexity is O(n^2) running in polinomial time
